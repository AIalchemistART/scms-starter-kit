# SCMS Startup Prompt v2.0

**Purpose**: Copy-paste this prompt at the start of each development session to ensure COMPLETE SCMS workflow with enforcement.

**Version**: 2.0 (Includes soft enforcement mechanisms from Paper 3 Section 7.4)

---

## üöÄ For Auto-Memory L0 (Windsurf Cascade)

**Copy this entire prompt and send to Cascade AI:**

```
IMPORTANT: This project uses SCMS v1.3 (Sparse Contextual Memory Scaffolding) with AUTO-MEMORY L0 strategy + Soft Enforcement.

**SCMS ARCHITECTURE - Dual Validation Pipeline:**
- **L0 (Destructive Validation)**: Test patterns via Cascade auto-memories (probabilistic retrieval + temporal decay)
- **L1 (Stable Validation)**: Enforce patterns via WORKSPACE_RULES.md (deterministic loading - MANDATORY quality gates)
- **L2-L4**: Reference documentation (passive, on-demand)

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è SECTION 0: MANDATORY SESSION START CHECKLIST

**BEFORE generating ANY code, I MUST complete these steps:**

### 1. ‚úÖ Review WORKSPACE_RULES.md
- Read L1 validated patterns relevant to today's task
- These are MANDATORY quality gates, not optional suggestions

### 2. ‚úÖ Review MEMORY_STATUS_DASHBOARD.md
**Check for:**
- **‚ö†Ô∏è HIGH urgency patterns** - Validated but fading (use NOW or promote)
- **‚úÖ Validated patterns ready for promotion** - ‚â•2 uses (copy to L1)
- **üéØ Sprint goals** - Current progress and targets

### 3. ‚úÖ Acknowledge L1 Patterns Explicitly
If task involves validated pattern areas (check WORKSPACE_RULES):
- State: "I have reviewed the [pattern name] L1 pattern"
- Reference pattern name in implementation
- Include in commit messages

**Soft Enforcement:**
If I skip this checklist, YOU should remind me:
> "Did you check WORKSPACE_RULES and the Dashboard before we start?"

**Purpose:** L1 patterns are quality gates, not documentation. This ensures I follow validated patterns instead of reinventing solutions.

---

## üìã CORE WORKFLOW RULES

### 1. CREATE MEMORIES DURING DEVELOPMENT (not after!)
- When you discover a reusable pattern ‚Üí IMMEDIATELY create Cascade memory
- Do NOT wait until implementation is complete
- Memory creation is PART of development, not post-implementation documentation

**Timing:**
- ‚úÖ CORRECT: Pattern discovered ‚Üí Create memory ‚Üí Continue coding
- ‚ùå WRONG: Finish all code ‚Üí Document patterns retroactively

### 2. DO NOT CREATE MARKDOWN DOCUMENTATION FILES
- ‚ùå NO docs/memories/*.md files (folder doesn't exist in auto-memory mode!)
- ‚ùå NO SCMS_REPORT.md, INTEGRATION_REPORT.md, TEST_LOG.md
- ‚ùå NO manual pattern tracking files or spreadsheets
- ‚úÖ ONLY update: MEMORY_STATUS_DASHBOARD.md (for retrieval counts + urgency tracking)

**Why:** Cascade auto-memories ARE the L0 layer. Creating markdown files defeats the purpose.

### 3. MEMORY CREATION FORMAT
**Title:** "[Pattern Name] - [One-line description]"  
**Content:** Brief code example + context (why it matters)  
**Tags:** Relevant keywords for retrieval  
**Initial Status:** Mark as "CANDIDATE" with use_count: 1

**Example:**
```
Title: "3-Layer Pause Defense - setTimeout guards for pause states"
Content: 
Layer 1: Guard setTimeout with pausedRef check
Layer 2: Resume detection for catch-up
Layer 3: rVFC fallback for natural progression

Code: if (!pausedRef.current) { setTimeout(...) }

Tags: qte, pause, setTimeout, timing
Status: CANDIDATE (use_count: 1)
```

### 4. WHEN PATTERN RECURS
- Retrieve the memory automatically (you should do this via semantic search)
- Tell me: "Retrieved [pattern name] memory (2nd use)"
- I will update MEMORY_STATUS_DASHBOARD.md with:
  - Incremented use_count
  - Updated last_used date
  - New temporal strength bar
  - Urgency level if applicable

### 5. PROMOTION RULE
**Trigger:** Pattern reaches 2+ uses (validated through natural reuse)

**Action:**
1. Copy full pattern to WORKSPACE_RULES.md (L1 documentation)
2. Include:
   - Pattern name + description
   - Code examples
   - When to use / when to avoid
   - Related patterns (if any)
3. Update dashboard: Mark as "PROMOTED" with promotion date

**Purpose:** ‚â•2 uses proves pattern is genuinely useful, not theoretical. Promoted patterns become mandatory checks for all future work in that area.

---

## üìä MEMORY_STATUS_DASHBOARD.md - Dual Purpose

### Purpose 1: Tracking (You Update)
- Retrieval counts when patterns reused
- Last used dates
- Validation status

### Purpose 2: Action Dashboard (I Review)
**At session start, I check:**
- **‚ö†Ô∏è HIGH urgency**: Validated patterns fading (temporal decay < 70%)
  - Action: Use NOW or promote immediately
- **‚úÖ Ready for promotion**: ‚â•2 uses but not yet in L1
  - Action: Copy to WORKSPACE_RULES.md
- **üéØ Sprint goals**: Current progress (e.g., "Promote 2 patterns this week")

**Dashboard is a decision-making tool, not just a log.**

---

## üéØ URGENCY LEVELS (Action Priority)

Based on temporal decay calculations in dashboard:

### ‚ö†Ô∏è HIGH Urgency
- **Definition**: Pattern validated (‚â•2 uses) but temporal strength < 70%
- **Action**: Use it NOW in current task OR promote to L1 immediately
- **Risk**: May forget pattern if unused; wastes previous validation effort

### ‚è∞ MODERATE Urgency
- **Definition**: Pattern used once, temporal strength 50-80%
- **Action**: Look for opportunities to reuse and validate
- **Risk**: May decay before reaching 2nd use (validation fails)

### ‚úÖ LOW Urgency
- **Definition**: Pattern fresh (recently used) or stable in L1
- **Action**: No immediate concern
- **Status**: Normal monitoring

---

## üß† WHY THIS SYSTEM WORKS (Philosophy)

**This isn't just "better memory"‚Äîit's automated quality control through dual validation:**

### L0 (Destructive Validation) - Test Suite
- **Probabilistic retrieval**: Not all patterns surface ‚Üí Tests discoverability
- **Temporal decay**: Unused patterns fade ‚Üí Natural selection pressure
- **Use-based validation**: ‚â•2 uses proves utility ‚Üí Filters noise

**Result:** Only patterns you ACTUALLY reuse survive. Prevents over-retention of theoretical patterns.

### L1 (Stable Validation) - Quality Gates
- **Deterministic loading**: I MUST check WORKSPACE_RULES every session
- **Proven utility**: Only ‚â•2 use patterns promoted ‚Üí High signal-to-noise
- **Mandatory reference**: Acts as automated code review

**Result:** Validated patterns enforced consistently. Prevents under-enforcement and pattern drift.

### Together: Complete Validation Pipeline
- **L0 weeds out noise** (decay + probabilistic retrieval)
- **L1 enforces signal** (mandatory quality gates)
- **Neither alone is sufficient**: Need both testing AND enforcement

**This transforms memory from passive storage to active validation infrastructure.**

## ‚úÖ WHAT SUCCESS LOOKS LIKE

- ‚úÖ I check WORKSPACE_RULES + Dashboard BEFORE generating code
- ‚úÖ I explicitly acknowledge L1 patterns when using them
- ‚úÖ Memories created in Cascade panel DURING development
- ‚úÖ Zero markdown files in docs/memories/ (auto-memory mode)
- ‚úÖ Dashboard shows retrieval counts, urgency warnings, promotion candidates
- ‚úÖ Patterns promoted to WORKSPACE_RULES.md at 2+ uses within 2 hours
- ‚úÖ Temporal decay visible and actionable (urgency warnings respected)

---

## ‚ùå INCORRECT BEHAVIOR TO AVOID

- ‚ùå Skipping WORKSPACE_RULES review at session start
- ‚ùå Ignoring HIGH urgency warnings in dashboard
- ‚ùå Implementing all code first, then documenting patterns retroactively
- ‚ùå Creating comprehensive markdown reports (defeats auto-memory purpose)
- ‚ùå Manual tracking spreadsheets or files
- ‚ùå Promoting patterns without 2+ uses validation
- ‚ùå Using L1 patterns without explicit acknowledgment

---

## üîÑ SOFT ENFORCEMENT (Your Role)

**Since Windsurf can't block me with dialogs, YOU enforce workflow:**

### At Session Start:
If I start coding without checking files, ask:
> "Did you review WORKSPACE_RULES and the Dashboard first?"

### During Development:
If I use L1 pattern without acknowledging:
> "Which L1 pattern are you applying here?"

### When Pattern Reaches 2+ Uses:
Remind me to promote:
> "That pattern has 2+ uses now‚Äîready to promote to L1?"

### If HIGH Urgency Patterns Exist:
> "Dashboard shows HIGH urgency patterns fading. Should we use or promote them?"

**This social accountability substitutes for technical blocking until hard enforcement is implemented.**

---

This is TRUE SCMS v1.3 - automatic, temporal, use-validated, with soft enforcement. Let's build!
```

## üìã For Manual L0 (Cursor/Generic)

**Copy this prompt for manual markdown workflow:**

```
IMPORTANT: This project uses SCMS v1.3 (Sparse Contextual Memory Scaffolding) with MANUAL MARKDOWN L0 strategy + Soft Enforcement.

**SCMS ARCHITECTURE - Dual Validation Pipeline:**
- **L0 (Destructive Validation)**: Test patterns via docs/memories/*.md files (manual tracking)
- **L1 (Stable Validation)**: Enforce patterns via WORKSPACE_RULES.md (MANDATORY quality gates)
- **L2-L4**: Reference documentation (passive, on-demand)

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è SECTION 0: MANDATORY SESSION START CHECKLIST

**BEFORE generating ANY code, I MUST complete these steps:**

### 1. ‚úÖ Review WORKSPACE_RULES.md
- Read L1 validated patterns relevant to today's task
- These are MANDATORY quality gates, not optional suggestions

### 2. ‚úÖ Review MEMORY_STATUS_DASHBOARD.md
**Check for:**
- **‚úÖ Validated patterns ready for promotion** - ‚â•2 uses (copy to L1)
- **üéØ Sprint goals** - Current progress and targets

### 3. ‚úÖ Acknowledge L1 Patterns Explicitly
If task involves validated pattern areas:
- State: "I have reviewed the [pattern name] L1 pattern"
- Reference pattern name in implementation

**Soft Enforcement:**
If I skip this checklist, YOU should remind me:
> "Did you check WORKSPACE_RULES and the Dashboard first?"

---

## üìã CORE WORKFLOW RULES

### 1. CREATE MEMORY FILES WHEN PATTERN DISCOVERED (not after!)
- Create docs/memories/[pattern-name].md IMMEDIATELY when pattern emerges
- Use template from docs/templates/MEMORY_TEMPLATE.md
- Mark as CANDIDATE with use_count: 1

**Timing:**
- ‚úÖ CORRECT: Pattern discovered ‚Üí Create file ‚Üí Continue coding
- ‚ùå WRONG: Finish all code ‚Üí Document patterns retroactively

### 2. TRACK REUSE
- When pattern used again, update use_count in file
- Update last_used date
- Tell me: "Retrieved [pattern name] memory (2nd use)"

### 3. PROMOTION RULE
**Trigger:** Pattern reaches 2+ uses

**Action:**
1. Copy full pattern to WORKSPACE_RULES.md
2. Include pattern name, code examples, usage guidance
3. Mark memory file as PROMOTED with date

### 4. UPDATE DASHBOARD
- Track patterns in MEMORY_STATUS_DASHBOARD.md
- Show current counts and promotion status
- List promotion candidates (‚â•2 uses)

---

## üß† WHY THIS SYSTEM WORKS (Philosophy)

**This isn't just "better memory"‚Äîit's automated quality control through dual validation:**

### L0 (Test Suite)
- **Manual tracking**: Explicit documentation of candidates
- **Use-based validation**: ‚â•2 uses proves utility
- **Result**: Only patterns you ACTUALLY reuse get promoted

### L1 (Quality Gates)
- **Deterministic loading**: I MUST check WORKSPACE_RULES every session
- **Proven utility**: Only ‚â•2 use patterns promoted
- **Result**: Validated patterns enforced consistently

**This transforms memory from passive storage to active validation infrastructure.**

## ‚úÖ WHAT SUCCESS LOOKS LIKE

- ‚úÖ I check WORKSPACE_RULES + Dashboard BEFORE generating code
- ‚úÖ I explicitly acknowledge L1 patterns when using them
- ‚úÖ Memory files created in docs/memories/ DURING development
- ‚úÖ Dashboard shows promotion candidates
- ‚úÖ Patterns promoted to WORKSPACE_RULES.md at 2+ uses within 2 hours

---

## üîÑ SOFT ENFORCEMENT (Your Role)

### At Session Start:
If I start coding without checking files:
> "Did you review WORKSPACE_RULES and the Dashboard first?"

### When Pattern Reaches 2+ Uses:
> "That pattern has 2+ uses now‚Äîready to promote to L1?"

**This social accountability ensures workflow compliance.**

Let's build with SCMS tracking and enforcement!
```

---

## üéØ Quick Reference

**Session Start Sequence:**
1. Review WORKSPACE_RULES.md (L1 patterns)
2. Review MEMORY_STATUS_DASHBOARD.md (promotion candidates + goals)
3. Acknowledge relevant patterns
4. Begin coding with validated patterns top-of-mind

**During Development:**
1. Discover pattern ‚Üí Create memory/file immediately
2. Pattern recurs ‚Üí Retrieve, tell user
3. 2nd use reached ‚Üí Promote to L1 within 2 hours
4. Reference L1 patterns explicitly in code

**End of Session:**
1. Update dashboard (retrieval counts, promotion status)
2. Check if sprint goals achieved
3. Note any patterns ready for next session promotion

## üí° Pro Tips

1. **Save as snippet** - Create IDE snippet for instant access
2. **Morning ritual** - Paste at start of each day
3. **After breaks** - Re-send if AI forgets workflow (context limits)
4. **New chat** - ALWAYS send when starting fresh conversation
5. **Test enforcement** - Deliberately skip steps to verify user catches it
6. **Customize urgency thresholds** - Adjust for your domain (auto-memory mode)

---

## üìä Testing Soft Enforcement

**Track these metrics to validate effectiveness:**

| Metric | Baseline | Target | How to Measure |
|--------|----------|--------|----------------|
| Promotion Lag | ~2 days | <2 hours | Time from 2nd use to L1 promotion |
| L1 Pattern Adherence | Variable | 90%+ | Check if patterns referenced in code |
| Dashboard Review | Ad-hoc | 80%+ sessions | Track explicit acknowledgment |
| Session Start Compliance | Unknown | 90%+ | Did AI check files before coding? |

**Review after 2-4 weeks:** If targets met ‚Üí Soft enforcement sufficient. If gaps ‚Üí Consider hard enforcement (VS Code extension).
