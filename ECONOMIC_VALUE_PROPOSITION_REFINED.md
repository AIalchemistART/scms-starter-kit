AI: [Retrieves L0 pattern] "Following the established timeout pattern..."
Tokens: 150 (50 thinking + 100 citation/adaptation)
Cost: $0.00225
Time: 3 seconds
```

**Without SCMS**:
```
User: "Fix the QTE timeout logic in shot007_01"  
AI: [Generates from scratch] "For QTE timeout handling, you need to..."
Tokens: 600 (200 thinking + 400 generation)
Cost: $0.009
Time: 10 seconds
```

**Impact**: 75% cost reduction, 70% time reduction, higher accuracy

### **Example 2: Cross-Paper Consistency**

**With SCMS**: 400 tokens, $0.006 cost  
**Without SCMS**: 1,200 tokens, $0.018 cost  
**Impact**: 67% cost reduction, consistent formatting, reduced errors
