This directory contains development history, version updates, and enhancement proposals for the SCMS Starter Kit.

## Contents

### Build Status

## Purpose

These documents track the **evolution of the SCMS Starter Kit**. They are:
- **Not required for setup** - Users don't need to read these
- **Useful for contributors** - Understand the project's development arc
- **Historical record** - See what changed and why

## For Contributors

If you're contributing to SCMS:
1. Check `BUILD_STATUS.md` for current priorities
2. Review enhancement proposals for context
3. Read version summaries to understand past decisions
4. See `CONTRIBUTING.md` in the root for contribution guidelines

## For Users

You don't need these files! Run the setup wizard and start coding. These docs are for people working on improving SCMS itself.
