# Setup Wizard Enhancement Summary

**Date**: October 27, 2025  
**Enhancement**: Interactive Threshold Configuration Wizard

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Problem Solved

**Before**: Users had to manually fill in threshold parameters in the startup prompt:
```
For this project:
- [ ] Project Phase: _________________ 
- [ ] Threshold: nâ‰¥_____ 
- [ ] Team: _________________
- [ ] Domain: _________________
```

**Issues**:
- Easy to skip or forget
- No guidance on what to choose
- Confusing for new users
- Error-prone manual entry

---

## âœ… Solution Implemented

### **1. Interactive Setup Wizard (setup.ps1)**

Added 3-step guided configuration at the **start** of the setup script:

**Step 1: Project Phase**
```powershell
[1] Greenfield (Weeks 1-4)
    - Patterns still emerging, architecture evolving
    - Threshold: nâ‰¥5 (higher validation bar)

[2] Establishing (Months 2-3)
    - Patterns stabilizing, core architecture forming
    - Threshold: nâ‰¥3 (moderate validation)

[3] Mature (4+ months)
    - Patterns proven, architecture stable
    - Threshold: nâ‰¥2 (standard validation)
```

**Step 2: Team Size**
```powershell
[1] Solo Developer
    - n_uniqueâ‰¥1 (your validation only)

[2] Small Team (2-5 people)
    - n_uniqueâ‰¥2 (two people must validate)

[3] Large Team (5+ people)
    - n_uniqueâ‰¥3 (three people must validate)
```

**Step 3: Domain Characteristics**
```powershell
[1] High-churn (web, mobile)
    - Fast evolution, adjust threshold -1

[2] Moderate (general software)
    - Standard evolution, no adjustment

[3] Stable (embedded, scientific)
    - Slow evolution, adjust threshold +1
```

---

### **2. Automatic Threshold Calculation**

The script calculates the final threshold:

```powershell
$finalThreshold = [Math]::Max(2, $baseThreshold + $domainAdjust)
```

**Examples**:
- Greenfield + Moderate domain: 5 + 0 = **nâ‰¥5**
- Establishing + High-churn: 3 + (-1) = **nâ‰¥2**
- Mature + Stable: 2 + 1 = **nâ‰¥3**

**Minimum threshold**: Always â‰¥2 (never lower)

---

### **3. Configuration Display**

After selections, the script shows:

```
========================================
YOUR SCMS CONFIGURATION:
========================================
Project Phase: Establishing
Team Size: Small Team (n_uniqueâ‰¥2)
Domain: High-churn

PROMOTION THRESHOLD: nâ‰¥2

This means patterns need 2 uses before promoting to L1
AND at least 2 unique team members must validate
========================================
```

---

### **4. Dashboard Integration**

The configured threshold is saved to **MEMORY_STATUS_DASHBOARD.md**:

```markdown
## Project Configuration

**Project Phase**: Establishing
**Team Size**: Small Team (n_uniqueâ‰¥2)
**Domain**: High-churn
**Promotion Threshold**: nâ‰¥2

*Patterns need 2 uses before promoting to L1 (WORKSPACE_RULES.md)*
```

This creates a **single source of truth** for the threshold that both:
- The user can reference
- The AI can read at session start

---

### **5. Simplified Startup Prompt**

**Before (v2.1 manual entry)**:
```markdown
**For this project:**
- [ ] Project Phase: _________________ (Greenfield / Establishing / Mature)
- [ ] Threshold: nâ‰¥_____ (5 / 3 / 2)
- [ ] Team: _________________ (Solo / Small / Large)
- [ ] Domain: _________________ (High-churn / Moderate / Stable)
```

**After (v2.1 with wizard)**:
```markdown
**CRITICAL: Your promotion threshold was configured during setup!**

**Check MEMORY_STATUS_DASHBOARD.md for your configured threshold:**
- Project Phase (Greenfield/Establishing/Mature)
- Team Size and n_unique requirements
- Domain characteristics
- **Your promotion threshold: nâ‰¥[X]**
```

**Benefits**:
- No manual entry needed
- Cleaner, less overwhelming prompt
- Single source of truth (dashboard)
- Harder to forget or misconfigure

---

## ðŸ“Š User Experience Flow

### **Old Flow (v2.1 before wizard)**:
1. Run setup script (creates files)
2. Open `SCMS_STARTUP_PROMPT.md`
3. Scroll to Project Context section
4. Manually fill in 4 parameters
5. Calculate threshold manually (maybe?)
6. Remember configuration each session

**Pain Points**: Manual, error-prone, forgettable

---

### **New Flow (v2.1 with wizard)**:
1. Run setup script
2. Answer 3 multiple-choice questions
3. Script calculates + displays threshold
4. Configuration saved to dashboard
5. Startup prompt references dashboard
6. AI reads dashboard at each session

**Benefits**: Guided, automatic, persistent

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Technical Details

### **Files Modified**:

**1. scripts/setup.ps1** (+114 lines at start)
- Added interactive threshold wizard
- Three-step configuration (phase, team, domain)
- Automatic threshold calculation
- Configuration storage in hashtable
- Enhanced dashboard template with config

**2. SCMS_STARTUP_PROMPT.md** (-48, +18 lines)
- Removed fill-in-the-blank sections
- Added reference to dashboard configuration
- Kept threshold guide for reference only
- Both auto-memory and manual sections updated

---

### **PowerShell Script Logic**:

```powershell
# Capture selections
$phaseChoice = Read-Host "Select project phase [1/2/3]"
$projectPhase = switch ($phaseChoice) {
    "1" { "Greenfield"; 5 }
    "2" { "Establishing"; 3 }
    default { "Mature"; 2 }
}

# Calculate final threshold
$finalThreshold = [Math]::Max(2, $baseThreshold + $domainAdjust)

# Store configuration
$THRESHOLD_CONFIG = @{
    Phase = $phaseName
    FinalThreshold = $finalThreshold
    # ... other fields
}

# Inject into dashboard template
$dashboardContent = @'
**Promotion Threshold**: nâ‰¥{7}
'@ -f ... $THRESHOLD_CONFIG.FinalThreshold
```

---

## âœ… Benefits Summary

### **For Users**:
1. **No guesswork**: Clear multiple-choice options with explanations
2. **No manual calculation**: Script handles threshold math
3. **No configuration loss**: Saved to dashboard permanently
4. **Cleaner prompts**: Startup prompt less overwhelming
5. **Better guidance**: Contextual help at decision time

### **For AI Assistants**:
1. **Single source of truth**: Dashboard has authoritative config
2. **Clearer instructions**: "Check dashboard" vs "user filled in somewhere"
3. **Consistent reference**: Same place every project
4. **Validation support**: Can confirm threshold from dashboard

### **For Project Teams**:
1. **Consensus configuration**: Team discusses settings together during setup
2. **Documented decisions**: Why this threshold? It's in the dashboard.
3. **Easy reconfiguration**: Re-run setup if project phase changes

## ðŸ”„ Migration Notes

### **Existing Users (already ran setup.ps1 v2.0)**:

**Option 1: Re-run setup**
```powershell
cd scripts
./setup.ps1
```
- Answer threshold questions
- Dashboard will be updated with configuration
- Startup prompt already references dashboard

**Option 2: Manually add to dashboard**
Edit `MEMORY_STATUS_DASHBOARD.md`:
```markdown
## Project Configuration

**Project Phase**: [Your Phase]
**Team Size**: [Your Team]
**Domain**: [Your Domain]
**Promotion Threshold**: nâ‰¥[Your Number]
```

### **New Users**:
- Just run `setup.ps1`
- Follow prompts
- Configuration handled automatically

---

## ðŸ“ˆ Version History

**v2.0** (Oct 26, 2025):
- Startup prompt with fill-in sections
- Manual threshold determination

**v2.1** (Oct 27, 2025):
- Added interactive setup wizard
- Automatic threshold calculation
- Dashboard integration
- Simplified startup prompt

---

## ðŸŽ‰ Summary

**What Changed**: Setup script now **guides users through threshold configuration** with multiple-choice questions, calculates the threshold automatically, and saves it to the dashboard. The startup prompt now **references the dashboard** instead of requiring manual fill-in.

**Why It Matters**: Removes friction from initial setup, prevents misconfiguration, and creates a single source of truth for threshold settings. Users get **better guidance at decision time** rather than staring at blank fields.

**User Impact**: Setup becomes **interactive and educational** rather than passive. Users understand **why** they're choosing each option, not just **what** to choose.
