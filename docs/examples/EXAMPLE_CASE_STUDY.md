## 📖 Implementation Journey

### Phase 1: Planning & Design (Day 1)

**Objectives**:
- Design 2-step interaction sequence
- Plan timing for each step
- Define success/failure paths

**Decisions Made**:

1. **Two Sequential Interactions**: 
   - Rationale: More engaging than single interaction
   - Alternatives considered: Three steps (too complex), one step (too simple)

2. **Separate Fail States**:
   - Rationale: Each step needs distinct failure outcome
   - Alternative considered: Single fail state (insufficient)

3. **Pause Safety as Priority**:
   - Rationale: User might pause mid-sequence
   - Must work flawlessly

**Architecture Design**:
```
Start → Interaction A → Timeout or Success
         ↓ Success              ↓ Timeout
    Interaction B          Fail State 01
         ↓
    Timeout or Success
         ↓              ↓
    Fail State 02    Success State
```

### Phase 2: Implementation (Days 2-4)

**Day 2**: Basic flow implementation
- Created state handlers
- Implemented simple timing
- Challenge: Chaining interactions properly

**Day 3**: Pause safety
- Discovered: Pause during delay between interactions causes fail
- Implemented: Three-layer defense pattern
- Result: All pause scenarios handled

**Day 4**: Fail state routing
- Discovered: Need two distinct fail states
- Created: Special naming (`_fail_01`, `_fail_02`)
- Implemented: Index-based routing

**Key Implementation Highlights**:

**Interaction Chaining**:
```javascript
function handleInteractionASuccess() {
  interactionCompletedRef.current = true;
  
  // Chain to B - but with pause safety!
  const sid = sessionIdRef.current;
  setTimeout(() => {
    if (sid !== sessionIdRef.current) return;  // Stale check
    if (pausedRef.current) return;             // Pause check
    
    interactionStartedRef.current = false;
    startInteractionB();
  }, 1970);  // Delay between interactions
}
```

**Fail State Routing**:
```javascript
function determineFailState(interactionIndex) {
  // Index-based routing for multiple fails
  const failStates = ['sequence_fail_01', 'sequence_fail_02'];
  return failStates[interactionIndex];
}

function handleInteractionFail() {
  const index = currentIndexRef.current;
  const failState = determineFailState(index);
  
  transitionTo(failState);
}
```

---

### Phase 3: Testing & Refinement (Day 5)

**Testing Strategy**:
- Manual testing of all paths
- Pause at every possible moment
- Timing measurements
- Edge case exploration

**Bugs Found & Fixed**:

1. **Immediate Fail on Resume from Mid-Delay**:
   - Cause: Pause check missing in setTimeout
   - Fix: Added `if (pausedRef.current) return;`
   - Prevention: Now in WORKSPACE_RULES as critical pattern

2. **Second Interaction Not Starting After Resume**:
   - Cause: No resume detection for mid-delay pause
   - Fix: Added Layer 2 defense (resume catch-up)
   - Prevention: Three-layer defense now standard

3. **Wrong Fail State When Second Interaction Failed**:
   - Cause: Index not tracked correctly
   - Fix: Proper index management
   - Prevention: Index reset added to play handler

**Refinements**:
- Timing adjustment: 1900ms → 1970ms (feels better)
- Fail animation duration: 800ms → 920ms (matches transition)

## 🚧 Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Pause Safety During Chaining Delay

**The Problem**:
User pauses between interaction A success and interaction B start. On resume, interaction B doesn't start OR starts immediately causing instant fail.

**Why It Happened**:
setTimeout doesn't pause when app pauses. Delay continues counting, fires immediately on resume regardless of user readiness.

**Attempted Solutions**:
1. Clear timeout on pause: ❌ Lost the chain entirely
2. Track remaining time: ❌ Complex, race conditions
3. Three-layer defense: ✅ Works perfectly!

**Final Solution**:
```javascript
// Layer 1: Prevent stale setTimeout
const sid = sessionIdRef.current;
setTimeout(() => {
  if (sid !== sessionIdRef.current) return;
  if (pausedRef.current) return;  // Critical!
  startInteractionB();
}, 1970);

// Layer 2: Catch up on resume
function handleResume() {
  if (interactionCompleted && !interactionBStarted) {
    const elapsed = getElapsedTime();
    if (elapsed >= 4.8) {  // Past chain point
      startInteractionB();
    }
  }
}

// Layer 3: rAF fallback
requestAnimationFrame(() => {
  if (elapsed >= 4.8 && shouldStart) {
    startInteractionB();
  }
});
```

**Lessons Learned**:
- Single check insufficient for timing-critical operations
- Need defense at multiple points (before, during, after)
- Pause/resume is harder than it looks

**Documentation Created**:
- L0 memory: "Three-Layer Pause Defense"
- Updated L1: WORKSPACE_RULES → Pause Safety
- Created L2 SOP: PAUSE_SAFETY_SOP.md

### Challenge 2: Multiple Fail States with Standard Naming

**The Problem**:
Standard naming (`sequence_fail`) works for one failure. But we have TWO failures (one per interaction). Need distinct states.

**Why It Happened**:
Original architecture assumed single fail outcome per sequence.

**Attempted Solutions**:
1. Reuse single fail state: ❌ Can't distinguish which interaction failed
2. Add suffix to base: ❌ `sequence_fail` vs `sequence_fail_01` inconsistent
3. Number all fails: ✅ `sequence_fail_01`, `sequence_fail_02`

**Final Solution**:
```javascript
// Detection must explicitly check special cases
const isFailState = stateName.endsWith('_fail') || 
                    stateName === 'sequence_fail_02';

// Routing uses index
function routeToFailState(interactionIndex) {
  const states = ['sequence_fail_01', 'sequence_fail_02'];
  return states[interactionIndex];
}
```

**Lessons Learned**:
- Don't assume one-size-fits-all naming
- Plan for multiple outcomes upfront
- Document exceptions clearly

**Documentation Created**:
- L0 memory: "Special Fail State Pattern"
- Updated L1: WORKSPACE_RULES → Special State Variants
- Pattern now used 8+ times in other sequences
