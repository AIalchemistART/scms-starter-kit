## Template Instructions (Remove This Section)

**To Create Case Study from This Template**:

1. **Copy to** `docs/case-studies/[FEATURE_NAME]_CASE_STUDY.md`
2. **Fill in all sections** with actual implementation details
3. **Include code examples** from the real implementation
4. **Add metrics** with real before/after numbers
5. **Document challenges** honestly (failures teach as much as successes)
6. **Remove template instructions** (this section)
7. **Link from WORKSPACE_RULES.md** as example for related patterns

**When to Create a Case Study**:
- Feature demonstrates multiple L2 SOPs working together
- Significant implementation milestone achieved
- Novel patterns discovered worth documenting
- Complex problem solved with reusable approach
- Team wants to share learnings

**Keep Case Studies**:
- Honest (include failures and iterations)
- Detailed (enough for others to learn)
- Practical (real code, real metrics)
- Referenced (link from L1/L2 docs)

This is **Layer 3** in SCMS - complete examples demonstrating multiple patterns in action.
