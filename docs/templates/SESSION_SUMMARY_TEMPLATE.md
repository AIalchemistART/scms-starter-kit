## Template Instructions (Remove This Section)

**To Create Session Summary from Template**:

1. **Copy to**: `docs/sessions/SESSION_YYYY-MM-DD.md`

2. **Fill in at end of session** (or continuously during)

3. **Focus on**:
   - What was accomplished
   - What was learned
   - What needs follow-up

4. **Update SCMS metrics**:
   - Track memory creation/promotion
   - Measure documentation lag
   - Note pattern re-use

5. **Link from** previous session summary

6. **Create next session** document at end

**When to Create**:
- End of each work session (daily summaries)
- End of sprint/iteration (sprint summaries)
- After major milestone (milestone summaries)

**Keep Summaries**:
- Consistent (same format each time)
- Honest (include failures and learnings)
- Actionable (next steps clear)
- Linked (easy to follow project history)

**This is Layer 4 (L4)** - Historical records providing long-term context and project continuity.
