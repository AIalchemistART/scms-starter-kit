## Template Instructions (Remove This Section)

**To Create Memory from Template**:

1. **Copy to**: 
   - Windsurf: Create in native memory system
   - Cursor/Generic: `docs/memories/[pattern-name].md`

2. **Fill in all sections** with actual pattern details

3. **Set initial values**:
   - Status: ‚è≥ CANDIDATE
   - Use Count: 1
   - First Used: Today's date
   - Last Used: Today's date

4. **Tag appropriately**: Use consistent tags for retrieval
   - Technology: javascript, python, react, etc.
   - Category: api, testing, performance, etc.
   - Type: pattern, optimization, workaround, etc.

5. **Update after each use**:
   - Increment use_count
   - Update last_used date
   - Add to usage history
   - Change status if validated

6. **Promote when ready**:
   - Use count ‚â•2: Add to WORKSPACE_RULES.md (L1)
   - Use count ‚â•5: Create SOP if complex (L2)
   - Mark as PROMOTED, link to new location

**This is Layer 0 (L0)** - Dynamic memories that prove utility through repeated use before promoting to permanent documentation.
