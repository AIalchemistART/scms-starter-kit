**Subject:** Windsurf just validated SCMS (and shipped something way worse) + Booksmaster updates

---

Hey Ani,

Quick responses on Booksmaster first, then something big on the SCMS/Windsurf front:

## Booksmaster Quick Hits

**On the "free version" question:** You're right to ask, but the gap is real. None of the competitors (QuickBooks, Xero, Wave, FreshBooks) offer a true free tier beyond 30-day trials. And even their trials dump the entire accounting suite on you - payroll, invoicing, inventory, etc. 

**What makes Booksmaster different:** It's the ONLY tool that offers:
- AI-powered receipt parsing (everyone else uses 2010-era OCR)
- A free tier focused on ONE thing: receipt scanning and categorization
- Nothing else - no bloat, no feature overload

Think CamScanner (document scanner app) but intelligent, and purpose-built for receipts. That's what inspired this more than accounting software did.

**Timeline update:**
- Core workflow: 3-4 days from done
- Backend + payments: ~1 week after that
- Then hitting local tax offices and chamber of commerce for early traction
- Product Hunt: Submitting in next 1-2 days (thanks for the reminder!)
- Stability: Tested on 3 Windows devices, core workflow solid

I'm confident I can get actual paying users (not just demos) within a few weeks of launch. That's a big differentiator from Mneme, where even finding demo users has been hard.

## The Big News: Windsurf Just Released "Skills" (and It's Embarrassingly Inferior)

Ani, I'm actually laughing out loud right now.

**What happened:** Three months ago, I reached out to 20-30 people at Windsurf on LinkedIn explaining how SCMS integrates perfectly with their system. One person responded - patronizingly - then ghosted me.

**Last week:** Windsurf released "Skills" - a tool that lets developers manually document workflows in markdown files.

**The problem:** SCMS does the exact same thing **automatically** - zero documentation burden on the developer. Skills requires developers to stop work, create folders, write documentation, and maintain it. SCMS discovers patterns while you work and promotes them to permanent memory after 3 occurrences.

**I wrote a blog post breaking it down:** https://mneme.ai/blog/scms-vs-windsurf-skills

Please read it when you get a chance - it's 8 minutes and explains why SCMS is basically "Skills 2.0."

## The Hail Mary: You're in Mountain View

Here's the opportunity: **Windsurf headquarters is in Mountain View.** You're local.

It would cost me $2,000+ to fly down, get a hotel, and try to make contact in person (since LinkedIn clearly didn't work). But you could potentially:
- Reach out to people at Windsurf (even cold)
- Try to set up a meeting or call
- Get us on a three-way conference where I can explain the system

**Why this matters:**
1. SCMS doesn't just compete with Skills - it **generates Skills automatically**
2. Skills could be the formalization layer for SCMS (they work together)
3. But the real win: Windsurf should integrate SCMS principles **natively** into their IDE

Right now SCMS is scaffolding - it works on top of Windsurf's existing memory system. If they integrated it natively, it would be exponentially more powerful and remove the human-in-the-loop maintenance needed to keep context.

I don't know exactly how much better native integration would be, but I know with absolute certainty it's the right direction.

**The ask:** If you have bandwidth to try making contact with someone at Windsurf - whether through your network or just showing up - that could be the break we need. They clearly won't respond to me, but a local founder with traction might get through.

## Bottom Line

- Booksmaster: 2 weeks from launch, high confidence on early traction
- SCMS: Just proved it's superior to what a well-funded IDE company shipped
- Opportunity: Your proximity to Windsurf could unlock a partnership that makes both products way better

Let me know your thoughts on the Windsurf angle - even if it's a long shot, it feels like the best Hail Mary we've got right now.

Talk soon,
Manny
