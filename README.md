**🔥 NEW (Dec 2025)**: Google's **Titans** and **MIRAS** papers (December 2025) provide definitive validation—multi-layer memory architecture and forgetting mechanisms are **essential** for AI memory systems. SCMS's L0/L1/L2 architecture and decay mechanism align perfectly with Google's findings. Competitors using flat vector databases (Mem0, etc.) are now **architecturally deficient** per Google's research!

**📜 Prior Validation (Nov 2025)**: Core SCMS principles **independently validated** across a 2-year convergence—**David Shapiro (2023)** theorized sparse activation architecture, **SCMS (2024-2025)** implemented production system, **Google Research (2025)** validated with "Nested Learning" (NeurIPS 2025), and **Ilya Sutskever (Nov 2025)** confirmed the "bug oscillation" problem that SCMS failure documentation directly addresses!

## What is SCMS?

**Sparse Contextual Memory Scaffolding** transforms AI memory from passive storage into **active validation infrastructure**. Unlike traditional documentation that AI may or may not follow, SCMS implements a **dual validation pipeline** where patterns are automatically tested (L0) and enforced (L1) through repeated use.

**Validated Results** (4-month game development project):
- ✅ **91% reduction** in pattern re-discovery time
- ✅ **94% knowledge retention** rate  
- ✅ **96% time reduction** in stale-context scenarios
- ✅ **<2 hour** documentation lag (was 2 days)
- ✅ **Zero documentation debt** after stabilization

---

## 🏆 Independent Validation: Multi-Year Convergence (2023-2025)

SCMS principles have been **independently validated** across a 2-year span by **six independent sources**:

**1. David Shapiro (2023)**: Theoretical Foundation
- Raw logs → roll-ups → KB articles architecture
- Sparse activation with gating thresholds
- Asymptotic knowledge growth patterns
- **Key insight**: Architecture was theoretically sound but lacked production tooling

**2. SCMS (2024-2025)**: Production Implementation
- First production realization with modern IDE integration
- 4-month validation: 91% time savings, 94% retention
- Dual validation pipeline (L0 testing + L1 enforcement)

**3. Google Research (2025)**: Architectural Validation
- "Nested Learning" (Behrouz et al., NeurIPS 2025) published ~10 days after SCMS
- Perfect alignment on 6/6 fundamental principles:

| Principle | Validated | Details |
|-----------|-----------|---------|
| **Nested Hierarchical Structure** | ✅ | Multi-level organization (Google: optimization, SCMS: validation) |
| **Multi-Time-Scale Updates** | ✅ | Different update rates per level (Google: parameters, SCMS: promotion) |
| **Distinct Context Flows** | ✅ | Each level has its own information flow |
| **Catastrophic Forgetting Prevention** | ✅ | Both solve forgetting through nesting |
| **Associative Memory Compression** | ✅ | Key-value storage and retrieval |
| **Continuum Memory System** | ✅ | Memory as a spectrum (Google: frequency, SCMS: abstraction) |

**Perfect 6/6 alignment** validates SCMS architecture from an S-tier research lab!

**4. Ilya Sutskever (2025)**: Problem Space Validation
- Dwarkesh Podcast interview (November 25, 2025)
- Described the "bug oscillation" problem (A→B→A→B) that SCMS failure documentation directly addresses
- Identified missing "continual memory" as root cause—exactly what SCMS provides
- **Key insight**: Problem recognized at highest levels of AI research; SCMS offers a working solution

**5. Google "Titans" Architecture (Dec 2025)**: Three-Layer Memory Validation
- Introduces **three-layer memory architecture** (Long-term, Core Attention, Persistent) that directly mirrors SCMS's L0/L1/L2
- Demonstrates multi-layer memory is **essential** for handling long contexts (>2M tokens)
- "Surprise metric" for deciding what to store validates SCMS's validation-based promotion approach
- **Key insight**: Flat vector databases cannot adequately capture rich information in long sequences

**6. Google "MIRAS" Framework (Dec 2025)**: Forgetting Mechanism Validation
- Identifies four essential design choices: Memory Architecture, Attentional Bias, **Retention Gate**, Memory Algorithm
- Explicitly states: **"Forgetting is as important as remembering"**—validates SCMS's decay mechanism
- Competitors (Mem0, Claude-mem, etc.) using flat storage without forgetting are **architecturally deficient** per this research
- **Key insight**: SCMS's decay for unvalidated L0 memories aligns with Google's "retention gates"

**Key Differences**:
- **SCMS**: First application to AI-assistant cognition (interface layer) with **production-validated system** (127+ cycles)
- **Google NL**: Applied to neural network training (model weights) with theoretical proof-of-concept

**Implications**: Independent discovery of identical principles across abstraction levels suggests these are **universal architectural patterns** for continual learning systems—not domain-specific heuristics.

## How It Works

SCMS implements **dual validation infrastructure** optimized for **30-45% cost reduction** through retrieval-over-generation:

### 💰 **Economic Optimization Core**
- **Retrieval-first bias**: Search L0/L1 before generating new content
- **Cost asymmetry**: Retrieval ($0.018) vs Generation ($0.033) per full session
- **Target efficiency**: >70% retrieval-based responses
- **Conservative impact**: $200-400 annual savings for users, $2-3.5M for platforms

SCMS transforms AI memory from passive storage to **active cost optimization**:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ VALIDATION PIPELINE (Active)            │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ L0: Destructive Validation              │
│  → Tests via probabilistic retrieval    │
│  → Temporal decay removes unvalidated   │
│  → Natural selection for patterns       │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ L1: Stable Validation                   │
│  → Enforces via deterministic loading   │
│  → AI MUST check before acting          │
│  → Quality gates for proven patterns    │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
         ↓ (references)
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ REFERENCE DOCUMENTATION (Passive)       │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ L2: Standard Operating Procedures       │
│  → High-frequency patterns (5+ uses)    │
│  → Deep documentation for common tasks  │
│ L3: Case Studies & Architecture         │
│  → Complete implementation examples     │
│  → Multiple patterns working together   │
│ L4: Global Rules                        │
│  → Universal standards & constraints    │
│  → Checked after L0 for compliance      │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
         ↓ (fallback)
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ LOW-FREQUENCY OVERFLOW (Experimental)   │
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ L5: Infrequent Patterns (3-6mo cycles)  │
│  → Validated but too rare for L0        │
│  → Prevents regeneration waste          │
│  → Checked before novel generation      │
│  → Lightweight docs for seasonal tasks  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Key Innovation**: L0 and L1 are **complementary validation systems**—L0 tests patterns experimentally, L1 enforces them universally. This transforms memory from "things AI might remember" to "automated quality control infrastructure."

## 🧠 Mind-Map Framework: Multi-Time-Scale Architecture

SCMS implements a **cognitive architecture** with three levels operating at different update frequencies—directly validating Google's discovery that "multi time-scale update [is] the key component to unlock continual learning":

```
RARE ←―――――――――――――――――――――――――――→ FREQUENT
       Update Frequency Spectrum

L0 (Foundation)     L1 (Implementation)    Dashboard (Session)
─────────────────   ───────────────────   ──────────────────
Abstract patterns   Concrete solutions    Immediate context
Cross-project       Project-specific      Session-specific  
Test via retrieval  Enforce via loading   Execute now
Days-weeks scale    Hours-days scale      Real-time scale

Example:            Example:              Example:
"QTE systems        "QTE timeout:         "Currently debugging
need timeout"       cancelQTE() @ 30s"    QTE cancellation"
```

**Why Multi-Time-Scale Works**: Different update frequencies create natural isolation. High-frequency session changes don't interfere with low-frequency pattern knowledge—**preventing catastrophic forgetting at the interface level** (parallel to how Google's Nested Learning solves it at model weights level).

---

## 💥 Failure Documentation as First Principles

**Key Insight**: Failures contain **10-100× more information** than successes.

- **Successes**: "This worked" (1 bit: true)
- **Failures**: "This failed because X, Y, Z" (N bits: full causal model)

### Failure Documentation Pyramid

```
       ╱▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔▔╲
      ╱ Bug Patterns ╲      ← L0: Highest value
     ╱ (Generalizable)╲       (prevents entire bug classes)
    ╱▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁╲
   ╱  Anti-Patterns   ╲     ← L0: High value
  ╱  (Design Lessons)  ╲      (guides architecture)
 ╱▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁╲
╱ Failed Approaches     ╲   ← L0: Medium value
  (Constraint Discovery)      (narrows solution space)
▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁▁
      Edge Cases         ← L1: Project value
   (Specific Handling)      (implementation details)
```

**Real Impact**: Documenting one bug pattern prevents 3-10 similar bugs. Failed approaches eliminate entire solution spaces, saving hours of exploration.

## 🎯 Two L0 Strategies

SCMS's L0 layer (active memories) works differently depending on your IDE:

### Auto-Memory (Windsurf) ✅ RECOMMENDED

- AI creates memories **automatically** during development
- **Zero overhead** - happens naturally
- Temporal decay keeps knowledge base clean
- **This is TRUE SCMS as researched** (91% time savings proven)

### Manual Markdown (Cursor/Generic)

- Create markdown files in `docs/scms/memories/`
- Manual tracking and promotion
- Works with **any AI assistant**
- Better for teams and compliance needs

**Setup script detects your IDE and helps you choose.**

**Full comparison**: See [L0_STRATEGY_COMPARISON.md](docs/reference/L0_STRATEGY_COMPARISON.md)

---

## Quick Start

### 📦 **Choose Your Setup Approach**

> **🤔 Not sure which to choose?**
> - **Testing SCMS?** → Use Option B (Standalone)
> - **Adding to existing project?** → Use Option A (Integration)
> - **Starting a new project?** → Use Option B (Standalone)

**Both options require running the setup script once to configure:**
- ✅ Promotion thresholds (greenfield/establishing/mature)
- ✅ IDE detection (Windsurf/Cursor/Generic)
- ✅ L0 strategy (auto-memory vs manual)
- ✅ Team size and domain adjustments

**Option A: Integrate into Existing Project**
- Copies only SCMS templates into your project
- Your existing code stays separate
- Run setup script from your project root

**Option B: Standalone (Recommended for testing/new projects)**
- Clone SCMS as your complete project
- Run setup script to configure
- Everything ready to go!

### 0. Configure Global AI Rules (Crucial Step)

SCMS requires a set of **Global Rules** in your AI's system memory to enforce protocol compliance (like failure logging and read-before-write safety).

1. Locate your AI's system prompt or global memory file (e.g., `memories/global_rules.md` in Windsurf).
2. Copy the contents of `docs/templates/GLOBAL_CODING_RULES_TEMPLATE.md` into it.
3. This ensures your AI follows SCMS protocols **across all projects**.

### 1. Install SCMS

#### Option A: Integrate into Existing Project

> **⚠️ IMPORTANT**: Open terminal in YOUR project root first, then run these commands.

**Unix/Mac/Linux:**
```bash
# Clone SCMS to temp location
cd ~/Downloads
git clone https://github.com/AIalchemistART/scms-starter-kit.git

# Return to your project and run setup (works from current directory!)
cd -
~/Downloads/scms-starter-kit/scripts/setup.sh

# Clean up temp files
rm -rf ~/Downloads/scms-starter-kit
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
# Clone SCMS to temp location
Set-Location $env:USERPROFILE\Downloads
git clone https://github.com/AIalchemistART/scms-starter-kit.git

# Return to your project and run setup (works from current directory!)
Pop-Location
& "$env:USERPROFILE\Downloads\scms-starter-kit\scripts\setup.ps1"

# Clean up temp files
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force "$env:USERPROFILE\Downloads\scms-starter-kit"
```

**What this does:**
- Detects your current directory as the project root
- Creates `docs/scms/`, `docs/templates/`, `rules/` there
- Copies only templates (not the entire repo!)
- Initializes INDEX.md, WORKSPACE_RULES.md, etc.

---

#### Option B: Standalone Setup (Testing/New Projects)

> **✅ Simplest approach** - 2 steps and you're running!

> ⚠️ **Replace `MY-PROJECT-NAME` with your actual project name** (e.g., `star-merchant-2d`, `my-game`, etc.)

**Unix/Mac/Linux:**

**Step 1:** Clone and enter directory
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AIalchemistART/scms-starter-kit.git MY-PROJECT-NAME && cd MY-PROJECT-NAME
```

**Step 2:** Configure (2-3 min, interactive)
```bash
./scripts/setup.sh
```

> ✅ **Setup automatically installs dependencies and launches the dashboard!**

**🔄 Relaunch Dashboard Later (if you close it):**
```bash
npm run dashboard:app
```

---

**Windows (PowerShell):**

**Step 1:** Clone and enter directory
```powershell
git clone https://github.com/AIalchemistART/scms-starter-kit.git MY-PROJECT-NAME; cd MY-PROJECT-NAME
```

**Step 2:** Configure (2-3 min, interactive)
```powershell
.\scripts\setup.ps1
```

> ✅ **Setup automatically installs dependencies and launches the dashboard!**

**🔄 Relaunch Dashboard Later (if you close it):**
```powershell
npm run dashboard:app
```

> **💡 What setup does:** Detects your OS/IDE, asks about project phase (greenfield/mature), configures thresholds. Takes 2-3 minutes, only needed once.

**Or Download ZIP:**
```powershell
# Windows
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "https://github.com/AIalchemistART/scms-starter-kit/archive/refs/heads/master.zip" -OutFile "scms.zip"
Expand-Archive -Path "scms.zip" -DestinationPath "./"
Rename-Item -Path "scms-starter-kit-master" -NewName "your-project-name"
cd your-project-name
Remove-Item "../scms.zip"
.\scripts\setup.ps1   # Configure
npm install
npm run dashboard:app
```

```bash
# Unix/Mac
curl -L https://github.com/AIalchemistART/scms-starter-kit/archive/refs/heads/master.zip -o scms.zip
unzip scms.zip
mv scms-starter-kit-master your-project-name
cd your-project-name
rm ../scms.zip
./scripts/setup.sh    # Configure
npm install
npm run dashboard:app
```

> **💡 Pro Tip**: Keep the dashboard open during development as your SCMS reference guide!

---

**🚀 How to Launch the Dashboard:**

**Method 1: Electron App with Integrated Tracking (Recommended)**
```bash
npm run dashboard:app
```
- ✅ All-in-one solution (monitoring + dashboard)
- ✅ Real-time tracking (auto-refresh)
- ✅ Visual interface with charts
- ✅ Session controls (start/stop buttons)

**Method 2: Browser-Based (Fallback)**
- Open `docs/tools/scms-dashboard.html` in your browser
- Use when Electron not available
- Requires manual monitoring setup

**Method 3: Quick CLI Check**
```bash
npm run dashboard
```
- Terminal output for quick status checks
- No real-time tracking

**Method 4: Terminal Dashboard (Between Sessions)**
```bash
npm run dashboard
# Quick CLI view of costs, patterns, ROI without opening browser
```

---

**🎯 Automated Token Tracking (NEW!)**

The checkpoint monitor automatically captures your Cascade AI token usage:

```bash
# First time only: Install dependencies
npm install

# Start monitor (if not using automated launcher)
npm run checkpoint:monitor
```

**How it works:**
1. Monitor watches clipboard for Cascade checkpoint data
2. Copy conversation anytime (Ctrl+A, Ctrl+C) to capture tokens
3. Auto-parses costs, patterns, and updates dashboard
4. Dashboard auto-refreshes every 5 seconds with live data!

**Complete Workflow:**
1. Start: `npm run dashboard:app`
2. Click **"Start SCMS Session"** in dashboard
3. Click **"Export Data"** when finished
4. Paste prompt in Windsurf (Ctrl+V) - AI creates checkpoint automatically!
5. Watch dashboard update with live token costs ✨
6. Click **"End Session"** when done
7. Click **"Export Data"** for analysis

**📊 View Results Anytime:**
```bash
# Terminal Dashboard - Beautiful CLI display
npm run dashboard

# Shows: session costs, SCMS vs baseline comparison, 
# top patterns with ROI, savings toward 30-45% target
```

**Key Advantage**: Algorithmic validation transforms economic claims from estimates to measurable facts! 📈

### 5. Start Developing

SCMS builds automatically as you work with your AI assistant!

```
You: "Implement feature X"
AI: [implements + auto-documents in L0]
You: [test and report results]
AI: [validates and promotes when pattern reused]
```

### 6. 🚨 **CRITICAL**: End Each Session Properly (Validation Commit Layer)

**The Validation Commit Layer is essential for SCMS long-term success!**

> **📋 Terminology Note**: In academic literature, this is called the **"Validation Commit Layer"** (emphasizing its role as a mandatory architectural component). In practical workflows, we call it **"Session Closure"** for simplicity.

> **📋 GET THE LATEST PROMPTS**: Launch the **SCMS Dashboard App** (`npm run dashboard:app`)  
> All session prompts are copy-paste ready in the dashboard UI (v3.0)

**Quick Version** (see dashboard for full details):
```
You: "SCMS SESSION CLOSURE - CRITICAL SYSTEM UPDATE

Great work on this feature! Now let's close the SCMS optimization loop:

1. PATTERN REFLECTION & VALIDATION
   - FAILURES FIRST (3-10× more informative than successes)
2. L0/L1 VALIDATION PIPELINE UPDATE (threshold: 2+ uses)
3. INDEX & CROSS-REFERENCE MAINTENANCE (NOT visual diagrams)
4. MEMORY DASHBOARD UPDATE (Cascade persistent memory)
5. ECONOMIC DASHBOARD UPDATE (cost/savings/ROI)
6. ORGANIZATIONAL FRAMING MAINTENANCE (L0/L1/Dashboard boundaries)
7. SYSTEM OPTIMIZATION (health status & compliance)

This ensures SCMS continues optimizing and compounding value over time."

AI: [reflects on session, updates L0/L1 pipeline, refreshes dashboards, promotes patterns]
```

**Without session closure, SCMS degrades into passive documentation instead of active continual learning.**

→ **[Complete Session Closure Guide](docs/guides/SCMS_SESSION_CLOSURE.md)** | **[Dashboard (Latest Prompts)](docs/tools/scms-dashboard.html)**

### Layer Responsibilities

| Layer | Purpose | Update Trigger | Examples |
|-------|---------|----------------|----------|
| **L0** | Validation candidates | Every implementation | "Multi-key QTE pattern" |
| **L1** | Quick reference | ≥2 uses (validated) | WORKSPACE_RULES.md |
| **L2** | Detailed procedures | ≥5 uses (standard) | Save system SOP |
| **L3** | Complete examples | Milestone features | Multi-sequence QTE case study |
| **L4** | Historical record | Session/sprint end | Session summaries |

---

## Real-World Example

### From Labyrinth Protocol (4-month game development)

**Problem**: Complex Quick Time Event (QTE) system with pause/resume, multi-sequence patterns, fail states.

**Without SCMS** (Month 1):
- Re-discovered pause safety pattern 8 times (~24 min each)
- Documentation lagged weeks behind code
- Edge cases lost between sessions

**With SCMS** (Months 2-4):
- Pattern captured once, auto-retrieved on subsequent uses (<2 min)
- Documentation updated within hours (recursive mode)
- Edge cases preserved in memories, promoted to WORKSPACE_RULES

**Result**: 127 implementation cycles completed with 91% time savings and zero documentation debt.

---

## When to Use SCMS (Scope & Suitability)

**v1.3 Research Finding**: SCMS delivers **differentiated benefits** based on project characteristics and context freshness.

### ✅ Maximum Value Scenarios (85-96% benefit)

**Best suited for:**
- **Stale context recovery**: Picking up old projects after weeks/months of inactivity
- **Long-horizon projects**: Multi-month or multi-year development with iterative pattern discovery
- **Complex evolving codebases**: Numerous edge cases, architectural patterns, and domain-specific knowledge
- **Knowledge-intensive work**: Research projects, complex software systems, technical content creation
- **Collaborative environments**: Teams sharing context and patterns across members

**Why it excels**: SCMS's dual validation pipeline (L0 test + L1 enforce) prevents catastrophic forgetting when context has decayed—the 96% time reduction in stale-context scenarios validates this.

### ✓ Moderate Value Scenarios (60-80% benefit)

**Well suited for:**
- **Established codebases**: Ongoing development with moderate pattern reuse
- **Projects with session gaps**: Regular breaks between work periods (days/weeks)
- **Team knowledge sharing**: Context continuity across developers
- **Iterative feature development**: Building on accumulated patterns

**Why it helps**: Continuous validation prevents re-discovery of known patterns and maintains knowledge continuity.

### △ Lower Value Scenarios (30-50% benefit)

**Still beneficial, but less critical:**
- **Greenfield projects**: Starting from scratch with fresh context (though still helps establish patterns)
- **Short-term tasks**: Projects under 1 month duration with limited pattern accumulation
- **Well-documented domains**: Areas with comprehensive existing documentation
- **Static workflows**: Patterns that don't evolve significantly over time

**Why it's less critical**: Fresh context and short timelines reduce the impact of forgetting; benefits still present but magnitude is lower.

### ❌ Not Recommended For

- **Throwaway scripts**: One-off automation with no reuse
- **Purely preference-based memory**: Personal facts, communication style (use standard AI memory for this)
- **Compliance/audit requirements**: Legal or regulatory documentation (use dedicated systems)

---

## The Necessity Question

**Is SCMS required or optional?**

**Research Answer (v1.3)**: SCMS is **practically necessary** for real-world projects under realistic constraints:

- **Growing knowledge** (K → ∞) + **Fixed resources** (C bounded) → Dense alternatives provably fail (O(K²) interference)
- **Temporal decay** (context goes stale) → Without validation infrastructure, patterns are repeatedly re-discovered
- **Continual learning pressure** → Standard documentation can't keep pace with discovery

**But**: In edge cases (unlimited resources, static knowledge, no temporal decay), simpler approaches may suffice—though such edge cases rarely exist in practice.

**Practical Guidance**: If your project lasts >1 month with iterative pattern discovery, SCMS transitions from "nice to have" to "structural necessity."

## Research Background

SCMS is based on published research from the **Labyrinth Protocol** project:

### Core Research Papers

**📄 [SCMS (Empirical)](docs/reference/WHITEPAPER.md)** - v2.0  
*Sparse Contextual Memory Scaffolding: A User-Facing Architecture for Continual Learning in AI-Assisted Development Workflows*

🔗 **SSRN Pre-print**: [papers.ssrn.com/abstract=5656271](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=5656271)

Introduces the **dual validation pipeline architecture** where Layer 0 (destructive validation) tests patterns through natural selection and Layer 1 (stable validation) enforces proven patterns through deterministic loading. This transforms AI memory from passive storage into active quality control infrastructure.

**v2.0 Additions**: Google Titans/MIRAS validation (Dec 2025) - Three-layer memory architecture and forgetting mechanisms validated as essential. Competitors using flat vector databases now architecturally deficient per Google's research.

**Key Results**:
- 91% reduction in pattern re-discovery time
- 94% knowledge retention vs 37% baseline  
- 96% time reduction in stale-context scenarios
- Documentation lag: 11.5 days → 4 hours
- Validated over 4 months, 127 implementation cycles

**📄 [Paradigm Shift (Design)](docs/reference/WHITEPAPER_PARADIGM_SHIFT.md)** - v2.1  
*Paradigm Shift in AI Memory: From Preference Storage to Continual Learning*

Documents the emergent paradigm shift from AI memories as "digital filing cabinets" to **dual validation infrastructure** (L0 test + L1 enforce). Fewer than 1% of users have discovered this pattern. 

**v2.1 Additions**: Google Titans/MIRAS validation (Dec 2025) - Validates paradigm shift from "save everything" to layered validation is architecturally necessary.

Includes comparative analysis across six dimensions, five design principles for validation-oriented systems, and multi-domain validation (research, content creation, data analysis, education).

**📄 [Mixture of Memories (Theory)](docs/reference/WHITEPAPER_MIXTURE_OF_MEMORIES.md)** - v2.1  
*Mixture of Memories: A Unified Framework for Sparse Activation Across Abstraction Levels*

Proves that sparse selective activation is not merely an optimization but a **structural necessity** for continual learning at scale. 

**v2.1 Additions**: Google Titans/MIRAS validation (Dec 2025) - Titans validates MoM's isomorphism between memory routing and MoE gating. MIRAS confirms impossibility theorems for dense alternatives.

Establishes formal mathematical framework proving structural isomorphism between SCMS dual validation pipeline (L0+L1) and Mixture of Experts architectures. Demonstrates sparse selective activation as a universal pattern from biological neurons to organizational systems.

**📄 [Economics of Continual Learning](docs/reference/WHITEPAPER_ECONOMICS.md)** - v1.4  
*The Economics of Continual Learning: How SCMS Transforms AI Development Costs*

Demonstrates that SCMS creates **30-45% cost reduction** in AI interactions through retrieval-over-generation optimization. Using real-world development data (127 cycles), shows SCMS transforms heavy users from sustainable customers.

**v1.4 Additions**: Google Titans/MIRAS validation (Dec 2025) - Deep memory more efficient at scale; forgetting mechanisms prevent memory overflow.

**Key Economic Findings**:
- Individual developers: $200-400 annual savings (conservative)
- Platform providers: $2-3.5M annual savings potential  
- Response efficiency: 2-3× faster through retrieval vs generation
- Quality improvement: Validated patterns eliminate hallucination

**📄 [HUMANE (Alignment)](docs/reference/WHITEPAPER_HUMANE.md)** - v1.1  
*HUMANE: Human-like Understanding through Memory, Alignment, and Negative Encoding*

Extends SCMS principles to **AI alignment** through severity-aware failure memory. Introduces the dual function of emotional processing (reward signal AND retrieval trigger) and the objective/subjective verification distinction that explains AI's "jagged" performance.

**v1.1 Additions**: Google Titans/MIRAS validation (Dec 2025) - "Surprise metric" mirrors severity encoding; retention gates validate severity-based retention.

**Key Contributions**:
- Theoretical reframing: Emotions as retrieval triggers, not just value functions
- The Puzzle vs Socks framework: Why AI excels at objective but fails at subjective tasks
- Four-layer HUMANE implementation stack with compounding benefits
- SCMS as proof-of-concept showing 2.8× completion rate improvement

Validated by Ilya Sutskever (Nov 2025) and Google Titans/MIRAS (Dec 2025).

**Important**: `examples/dogfood/` contains real files from developing the starter kit itself (dogfooding). They're examples to show what SCMS looks like in action—**don't copy them directly**. Use `docs/templates/` and run `scripts/setup.sh` or `scripts/setup.ps1` to initialize fresh files for your project.

`npm run dashboard` checks setup with `scripts/validate-setup.js`, then prints a terminal cost view. `npm run dashboard:app` opens the same dashboard in Electron (`electron/dashboard-main.js`) with checkpoint monitoring. Session data stays local in `economics-dashboard-data.json`, which `.gitignore` already excludes.
